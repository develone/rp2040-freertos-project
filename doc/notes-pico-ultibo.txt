Event groups have mainly two important terms such as event flag and event bits. The event group is basically 
a set of event flags. The event flag is a boolean value which is either ‘0’ or ‘1’. These boolean values 
show the occurrence or not-occurrence of an event. In FreeRTOS, EventBits_t. Variable is used to store the 
state of the event flag. If the value of EventBits_t is 1 that means an event related to this specific bit 
has occurred. Otherwise, if EventBits_t = 0, the event has not occurred.
