Merged Ultibo_Projects/picotransfer/RPi3/FileHandling.lpr with Ultibo_Projects/picoledonoff/RPI3/picoledonoff.lpr.
into  Ultibo_Projects/picotransfer/RPi3/picokltdwtultibo.lpr.  Now the hw version can read & parse one of 
2 64 x 64 image found in a64.bin or bb.bin.  Starting with rp2040-freertos-project/klt-test/main.c. Made modifications in rp2040-freertos-project/kltdwt-ultibo/main.c
whiich now sends Sync until a '4'  is sent from the host. Then it sends Ready and expects 4160 characters of data
which make up a 64 x 64 image with a CRC added added to each row.  The pico processes the image
and sends "Command (1 = Send or 0 = Wait):" When the '1' is received the pico sends the results of the  
"klt-feature-detect" and then with the "dwt lifting step".
